FSMonitor is a daemon process which runs in the vm.
FSMonitor receive "commands" from 'VmManager' by libvirt 9pfs. 

Basically the process works like this: 
	1.The 'VmManager' writes 'command string' to 'command' file on the libvirt 9pfs used by vm.
	2.The FSMonitor constantly detects file changes on the libvirt 9pfs. 
	3.The FSMonitor finds the newly created file, it then reads the file and execute the command. 

All the dependencies of FSMonitor should be satisfied by modules in this directory.

When deploying FSMonitor, just copy this directory into the vm.
