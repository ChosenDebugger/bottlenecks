To enable Env unittest, please make sure:

	1. br0 exists on TargetHost and connects with 'management network'.
	2. a vm image exists on Target Host.
	3. change options in configuration files in the "configuration" directory.
	4. copy public key to git server, for example:
		ssh-copy-id root@192.168.188.10
	   	note:
	   		192.168.188.10 is the server you config in "../configuration.py"
	   		this is needed for source manager which use 'git' to pull down sources.

run tests:
	python run_test.py
